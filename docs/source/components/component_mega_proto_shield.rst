Prototype Shield
===========================

.. image:: img/image421.png

The Prototype Shield makes it easy for you to design custom
circuits. You can solder parts to the prototyping area to create your
project, or use it with a Tiny breadboard to quickly test circuit ideas
without having to solder. It's got extra connections for all of the
Arduino I/O pins, and it's got space to mount through-hole and surface
mount integrated circuits. It's a convenient way to make your custom
circuit and Arduino into a single module.

**Specifications**

-  It can be overlayed on the Sunfounder Mega2560 board directly. A Tiny
   breadboard is provided, which you can use to do some simple
   experiments.

-  Provide a footprint for SOP28.

-  It's got extra connections for all of the Arduino I/O pins

-  We offer you pin22-pin53 bonding pad and you can use it to weld the
   component directly.
