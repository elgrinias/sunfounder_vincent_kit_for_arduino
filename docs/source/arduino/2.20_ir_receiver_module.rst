2.20 IR Receiver Module
=========================

Overview
-------------

In this lesson, you will learn to use IR Receiver Module. IR Receiver is
a component with photocell that is tuned to receive to infrared light.
It is almost always used for remote control detection - every TV and DVD
player has one of these in the front to receive for the IR signal from
the clicker. Inside the remote control is a matching IR LED, which emits
IR pulses to tell the TV to turn on, off or change channels.

Components Required

Fritzing Circuit
---------------------

In this example, we wire up the left pin (-) of IR Receiver Module to
GND, the middle pin to 5V, and the right pin (S) to pin 11.

Code
----------


.. note::

    * You can open the file ``2.20_irReceiver.ino`` under the path of ``sunfounder_vincent_kit_for_arduino\code\2.20_irReceiver`` directly.
    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE 1/2.
    * Then :ref:`ar_upload_code` to the board.
    * Please make sure you have added the library called ``IRremote``, detailed tutorials refer to :ref:`add_libraries_ar`.

After uploading the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can see that the
current value of the pressed button of IR Remote Controller displays on
the serial monitor.

Code Analysis
---------------------

There are two important parts to notice in this program.

①The code uses an extra file decodeKeyValue.ino to decode the values in
class decode_result into key value.The file will be opened together with
the main file.

②IR Remote function is achieved by calling IRremote.h library related
functions.

.. code-block:: arduino

    #include <IRremote.h>

**Library Functions：**

.. code-block:: arduino

    IRrecv(int recvpin)

Create IRrecv object to control a IR Receiver module.

.. code-block:: arduino

    decode_result

In this kit, results are usually 8-digit hexadecimal numbers starting
with 00FF. You can check decodeKeyValue.ino file in the sample file.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void enableIRIn()

Initialize the IR receiver module.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int decode(decode_results *results);

Decodes the received IR message. Returns 0 if no data ready, 1 if data
ready. Results of decoding are stored in results.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void resume()

Restart for receiving an other value.
